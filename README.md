# 🚗 EZDrive
This Repo contains codes for EZDrive, a car rental app as a Final Project for Course Mobile Programming

## 📝 What is EZDrive?
The main goal of this app is to provide a simple and user-friendly platform for renting cars and managing bookings, tailored specifically for users in Indonesia. 

Currently, there is a lack of dedicated car rental apps in Indonesia, making it difficult for users to find, book, and manage car rentals efficiently. 

This app bridges that gap by offering a straightforward solution to browse available cars, book them for specific dates, and track bookings, all within a single mobile application.
